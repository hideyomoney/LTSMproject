## Project Topic - RNN/LSTM for Time Series Prediction

### Requirements:
- You have to **code** one or more algorithms from the technique that you have studied on your chosen dataset. 
  You are free to use pre-processing and evaluations libraries, but the main algorithm should be coded by you.
- A log file of your experiments (i.e. runs) and hyper-parameters should be maintained and submitted.

### LSTM Implementation Features:
- **Custom LSTM Architecture**: LSTM with forget gates, input gates, output gates, and candidate values
- **Full Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)**: Complete gradient computation through all LSTM gates and hidden states
- **Time Series Prediction**: Stock market data (NASDAQ Composite Index) prediction using 10-day sequences
- **Data Preprocessing**: MinMax normalization and sequence generation for time series
- **Gradient-based Training**: Mini-batch gradient descent with accumulated gradients

## Documentation:

### 1. Complete LSTM Backpropagation
The `backward_one_sequence()` function implements full BPTT with:

#### Gate Gradient Computation:

- Input Gate: $\frac{\partial L}{\partial i_t} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial C_t} \times g_t \times \sigma'(i_t)$
- Forget Gate: $\frac{\partial L}{\partial f_t} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial C_t} \times C_{t-1} \times \sigma'(f_t)$  
- Output Gate: $\frac{\partial L}{\partial o_t} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial h_t} \times \tanh(C_t) \times \sigma'(o_t)$
- Candidate: $\frac{\partial L}{\partial g_t} = \frac{\partial L}{\partial C_t} \times i_t \times \tanh'(g_t)$

#### State Gradients:

- Hidden State: $\frac{\partial L}{\partial h_t}$ flows backward through time
- Cell State: $\frac{\partial L}{\partial C_t}$ accumulates from output gate and next timestep

#### Weight Gradients:

- Input Weights: $\frac{\partial L}{\partial W_i} += x_t \otimes \frac{\partial L}{\partial \text{gates}_t}$
- Hidden Weights: $\frac{\partial L}{\partial W_{\text{hidden}}} += h_{t-1} \otimes \frac{\partial L}{\partial \text{gates}_t}$
- Gate Biases: $\frac{\partial L}{\partial b_{\text{gates}}} += \frac{\partial L}{\partial \text{gates}_t}$

### 2. Activation Function Derivatives
Added derivative functions for backpropagation:
- **Sigmoid derivative**: `σ'(x) = σ(x) * (1 - σ(x))`
- **Tanh derivative**: `tanh'(x) = 1 - tanh²(x)`



The implementation follows the standard LSTM equations with full gradient computation:

### Forward Pass:
$$
\begin{align}
f_t &= \sigma(W_f \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_f) & \text{(Forget gate)} \\
i_t &= \sigma(W_i \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_i) & \text{(Input gate)} \\
g_t &= \tanh(W_g \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_g) & \text{(Candidate values)} \\
o_t &= \sigma(W_o \cdot [h_{t-1}, x_t] + b_o) & \text{(Output gate)} \\
C_t &= f_t \odot C_{t-1} + i_t \odot g_t & \text{(Cell state update)} \\
h_t &= o_t \odot \tanh(C_t) & \text{(Hidden state output)}
\end{align}
$$
- **Input Processing**: Each timestep processes normalized closing price
- **Gate Computations**: Four gates (input, forget, output, candidate) computed simultaneously
- **State Updates**: Cell state and hidden state updated sequentially through time
- **Output Generation**: Final hidden state mapped to scalar prediction


### Backward Pass:

- **Gradient Flow**: Gradients flow backward through time using chain rule, updating all weight matrices and biases.
- **Gate Derivatives**: Computed using chain rule for sigmoid and tanh activations
- **Weight Updates**: All weight matrices (W_input, W_hidden, W_output) and biases updated
- **Gradient Accumulation**: Gradients accumulated across all sequences before weight updates

## Results Achieved

- **Full BPTT**: MSE = 0.339, RMSE = 0.582
- **Output-Only**: MSE = 0.113, RMSE = 0.337

While the output-only training showed better immediate convergence on this specific dataset, the full BPTT implementation provides:
1. **Complete learning capability** for all LSTM parameters
2. **Proper gradient flow** through temporal dependencies  
3. **Numerical stability** with gradient clipping
4. **Scalability** to more complex datasets and longer sequences
