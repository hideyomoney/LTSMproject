## Project Topic - RNN/LSTM for Time Series Prediction

### Requirements:
- You have to **code** one or more algorithms from the technique that you have studied on your chosen dataset. 
  You are free to use pre-processing and evaluations libraries, but the main algorithm should be coded by you.
- A log file of your experiments (i.e. runs) and hyper-parameters should be maintained and submitted.

| Experiment Number | Parameter Chosen | Results |
|-------------------|------------------|---------|
| 1 | Neural Net:<br> Number of layers = 4<br>Neurons = (8, 8, 4, 2)<br>Error Function = RMSE<br>Regularization Parameter = 0.6<br> | Train/Test Split = 80:20<br>Size of dataset = 10,000<br>Training Accuracy = 95%<br>Test Accuracy = 88%<br>Training RMSE = 1.67<br>Test RMSE = 3.08 |
